a
CPU sockets : 1 
CPU cores : 4
Number of CPU's : 4

b
CPU 1 : 2279.531 MHz
CPU 2 :	1599.960 MHz
CPU 3 : 2307.421 MHz
CPU 4 : 1600.546 MHz

c
Total Memory : 8007228 kB

d
Free Memory      : 4201232 kB
Available Memory : 5451984 kB
Difference between them : 1250752 kB

e
83

f
10462769

g
The files are of size 0 bytes. 
Question of investigation : If they are storing some information, why is it showing 0?


Q2

For program 1 :
VmSize : 8136 kB
VmRSS : 640 kB

For program 2 :
VmSize : 12048 kB 
VmRSS : 644 kB

For program 3 :
VmSize : 8136 kB
VmRSS : 3092 kB

For program 4 :
VmSize : 8136 kB
VmRSS : 5232 kB

As, VmSize is the sum of memory allocated, programs 1,3 and 4 have the same memory allocated in them.Hence, they have same VmSize. In program 2 , the array size is increased, so memory allocated is more.
Hence,it has high VmSize compared to program 1,3 and 4.

VmRSS is high for program 3 and program 4 (as compared to program 1 and 2) because number of instructions to be run are more in these two programs (we are iterating through the for loop)
Program 4 (VmRSS) > Program 3 (VmRSS) because we are iterating through the entire loop in Program 4 but in Program 3 , we iterate through half the loop.

Q3
15 sub processes

Command : ps -ef | grep './subprocesses <roll-no>' -c

Q4

empty system calls : 26
hello system calls : 39

a

Lines 1-25 are common between the two strace outputs, (they have the same system calls).
Line 26 of the output of strace ./empty is also common with line 39 of strace ./hello
Lines 26-38 of strace ./hello are specific to the program.

b
The first program (empty) does not have any unique system calls.
The second program (hello) has 3 unique system calls -- getpid() , write() and lseek().
