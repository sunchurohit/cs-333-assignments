Reason about the outputs:

hierarchy : parent > child > grandchild

if grandchild sleeps more than the child, then by the grandchild wakes up the child has already exited and the signal handler of the child's process won't be invoked.
Hence, we get only one output regarding the exit (basically when the parent's signal handler is invoked when the child exited). (total 3 outputs)

if the grandchild sleeps less than child , then by the grandchild wakes up the child has not exited yet (it is still sleeping) ,
but now , the signal handler of the child is invoked and DISTURBS THE SLEEP of the child and we get the output of grandchild's exit and child's exit almost instantly 
because after signal handling , the child also exits almost instantly. (total 4 outputs)
